# Simple "Hello World" workflow - most basic CI example
# WORKFLOW SYNTAX GUIDE:
# - YAML format: Uses spaces (not tabs) for indentation
# - Comments: Lines starting with # are ignored
# - Key-value pairs: key: value format for configuration

# Workflow name: Displayed in GitHub Actions UI
name: Hello World CI

# TRIGGERS: When this workflow runs
# Syntax: on: <event>: <configuration>
on:
  push:  # Trigger on push events to main branch
    branches: [ main ]  # Array syntax using [ main ] - runs when code is pushed to main
  pull_request:  # Also trigger on pull requests to main branch
    branches: [ main ]  # This is a separate trigger - workflow runs on both push AND pull_request

# JOBS: Collection of tasks to execute in this workflow
# Syntax: jobs: <job_id>: <job_configuration>
jobs:
  hello:  # Job ID: "hello" - internal identifier for this job (can be any name)
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Which Operating System/Runner: ubuntu-latest = Linux environment with latest Ubuntu version
    
    steps:  # Sequential actions executed in order. Syntax: - (list of step objects); Each step is a single action in the job
      - name: Say Hello  # Syntax: - name: <display_name> - appears in the GitHub UI
        run: echo "Hello from GitHub Actions!"  # Execute a shell command in bash (default shell on Linux)

      - name: Print Environment  # Display GitHub context information; Syntax: ${{ context.field }} accesses runtime variables
        run: |  # run: | allows multi-line shell commands (each line below is a separate echo command)
          echo "Branch: ${{ github.ref }}"  # Full branch reference (e.g., refs/heads/main)
          echo "Event: ${{ github.event_name }}"  # Type of event that triggered the workflow (push, pull_request, etc.)
          echo "Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"  # Repository in owner/repo format
